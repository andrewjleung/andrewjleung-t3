My fingers squeezed between half steps on the\nneck of a violin. Despite the inconvenience, I kept creating small.\nSmall handwriting, small cartoon characters in the corners of papers,\nnoodling on a three-quarter size guitar, harmonizing under my breath in\nfalsetto to my favorite songs.\n\nListening on tiny earbuds, I was perplexed by how my favorite songs,\nhitching themselves on waves of imperceptible, tiny particles in the\nair, could be perceived on such a gigantic scale. Each strum, strike,\nand strain of voice slipped through a tiny speaker grate. And yet, they\nhad the strength to stir a deep instinctual response in me, lifting\nhairs on my neck and arms.\n\nDissecting these small recordings, I spent weekends and car rides\npainstakingly recreating sounds and arrangements in GarageBand's mobile\napp. I manually tapped in MIDI runs, aimlessly played with parameters\nfor effects I hardly knew the purpose off (lord knows what a compressor\ndoes, I thought it just made guitars sound more plucky though that's not\ntoo far off), and recorded audio through the tiny hole of a speaker\nwithin my headphone's volume module.\n\nThose small recordings soon grew too large for a tiny touchscreen. I\nneeded more from audio. There was so much more ground I could cover, and\nso little room left on my phone's storage. Come senior year of high\nschool, I wandered into the territory of professional-grade production\nsoftware. Skipping the desktop version of GarageBand entirely, I soon\nfound myself staring into the gaping hole that is a fully fledged DAW,\nLogic Pro X to be specific. I was soon inundated with dynamic and\ntime-based effects, modulators, parametric EQ, routing, and an extensive\nlibrary of sounds and instruments.\n\nFor a time, it was new, wonderful, intriguing. I had no idea what was\nactually going on with the turn of each knob, how to best use each tool\nto make my recordings better, or what “better” even meant. For a time,\nit meant “soaked in reverb” and “muddy to hell,” but these were rites of\npassage. Porting over my sessions from GarageBand, I fleshed out their\nbarebones ideas, re-recorded other aspects, fantasized about showing\nthese songs to everyone I knew like I had something to prove. With every\ntool you ever could need at your disposal, you can achieve anything,\nright?\n\nWhen I used to toil over tiny controls, furiously thumbing my phone\nscreen in landscape to write out a MIDI melody, ideas were immediate.\nWhatever I heard could precipitate in an instant, a single touch. There\nwas never a time I stared at that tiny screen and felt lost. And yet,\nhere I was, sitting in front of Logic's premier sampler synth, Alchemy,\nstumbling and tripping down a preset browser without a single aim. There\nwas no transformation or transmutation from one element to another, just\na cacophony of one-second previews as I looked for a sound that would\ntrigger some inspiration.\n\nAt times I labored in Logic for hours, coming out with nothing to show\nfor it but two chords and a slightly sweatier chair. Making a recording\nfelt tedious. Plug in the guitar. Check the levels. Noodle. Record a\nlittle chord progression. It's clipping? Check the levels again. Fixed?\nWell, now you've listened to that chord progression too much and hate\nit. Why not just jam that one riff you know from that one song? Sounds\nbetter than anything you could ever come up with.\n\nMaybe I'll call it a day.\n\nI think I accidentally called it a few years. Across my time as an\nunderclassman, very little happened. Not a single finished song. Not a\nsingle idea that came to fruition. Hours and hours spent in Logic,\nAbleton, even FL Studio on rare occasion, but very little progress.\nEvery now and then there'd be a recording done for a class which I'd\nfeel satisfied with.

That sense of wonder and curiosity, motivation and\ngratification, that unadulterated drive to create, gone. I watched as\nmusicians around me put love into their craft, made both bad music and\ngood music. They seemed okay with the bad music. I wouldn't stand it for\na single second if it came from my hands, so I made nothing. I listened\nand fantasized that I had some x-factor which set me apart from them.\nIt's okay I never finished or put anything out, as long as I could\nconvince myself I was better than them.\n\nBut musicians these days are talented. Ludicrously talented. If you've\nsomehow convinced yourself for a second that you can keep up with these\nartists who really give it their all, you're definitely wrong. They love\nthis craft. They have the guts to bare their work to themselves and\nothers.
