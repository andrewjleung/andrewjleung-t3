This is the new repo for my personal site/portfolio/blogging space, made with [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/) for no reason really other than that I wanted to play with these technologies.

Overall, this app "uses" the following technologies:

- Next.js
- tRPC
- Prisma
- DatoCMS
- GraphQL

## Why tRPC?

It's cool, and my personal website is low stakes. If I ever want to introduce more sophisticated interactions, it'll be quite nice to use. I know, my reasoning is not bulletproof, but I'm just trying to have fun with it.

## Why Prisma?

See the above.
