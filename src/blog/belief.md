My mom hounds me on my younger aspirations, with them I whittled a deep tick in the doorway. Followed whatever whim, paid no mind my alma mater, rode on coattails, my father’s salary. Time and time again I’d feel capable, sometimes more, enough to feel ashamed of pride, not quite enough to savor it.

I won’t speak lofty of my career. I write code for corp. Enough to enjoy the process a few times per quarter, not quite enough to boot my editor past five. Hobbies die fast, hard, inexplicably. Your boulder is not yet optimized for productivity. Your hill’s color scheme needs tweaking.

Thought I’d live the dream, the small one, thought I’d climb a wall, not figuratively. It’s amazing, oh the places you’ll shut your brain off in. Fifteen feet up? Enough to fear, not quite enough to wake up.

Thought I’d encroach on a disorder. Enough to feel unable, not quite enough to convince you. Psych testing: half a month’s rent only to forget long division. I didn’t know my doorway ticks measured in math problems. Later the lovely intake confides in me, he too is in disorder, in fact, he is the prototype. He doesn’t see himself in me. He wishes me well, and that Jenny would’ve chosen med school. Jenny is currently at work.

In time your favorite sitcoms dull, at approximately the eleventh rerun. Your talents grey at the first vouch of faith. Your body’s center shifts and your legs sink down. You stare up and welcome a murky silence, you find the floor and perceive the ceiling. You follow your counselor’s words for once, turn to your ears, and listen. Enough to love the sound, not quite enough to feel its warmth.

Junkie, dissatisfied, attention-seeking, attentively bankrupt. Your prescription reads bootstraps. Your second opinion is self-fulfilling. Why can’t we settle for riffs and repetitions?

Enough to be enough, not quite enough.

I floated downstream to the clinic with good Google reviews. They tasted my blood and challenged my stillness on sturdy seats. Referenced, cross-referenced, made me curse a high deductible. In our morning tele-health, the doctor made her confirmation. I exited the Zoom meeting, opened my work laptop, checked Slack, then my emails.

Oh, to titrate, watch pharmacists come and go. Jenny returns from her frequent aisles with stripes on her hands, aerosol fragrances. Maybe, just maybe, a few milligrams more and this racing heart will elicit my true potential. Maybe, just maybe I won’t be able to pee.

In years to come I will expense these receipts and recall a year’s worth of orange bottles. The chills, appetites, weird moments in Irish bathrooms. Non-stimulants, thank you for all your sensations.

I think I first felt belief a few months ago, after passing a technical screen. I had been studying for a month at that point, and while proud for a moment, conceded to the proceeding preparations. The nights did not fly, my highs did not high, we were calm and lucid, opinionated. A month later I cleared the onsite.

Years prior, my mom asked why I never measured myself taller. I thought it dishonest to stand on my toes. I hadn’t given thought to the height of my toes, the bend in my knees, a slouch in my back, looking down, arms not reaching, torso not turned, fingers furled, nails clipped. I hope to make it home before we sell it, to give another notch to the door, for future tenants. I’ve always been home I guess, I’ll believe it so.
