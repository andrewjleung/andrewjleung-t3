				By sophomore year of high school, I had rather large hands. On smaller
				phones, I fumbled keys. My fingers squeezed between half steps on the
				neck of a violin. Despite the inconvenience, I kept creating small.
				Small handwriting, small cartoon characters in the corners of papers,
				noodling on a three-quarter size guitar, harmonizing under my breath in
				falsetto to my favorite songs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Listening on tiny earbuds, I was perplexed by how my favorite songs,
				hitching themselves on waves of imperceptible, tiny particles in the
				air, could be perceived on such a gigantic scale. Each strum, strike,
				and strain of voice slipped through a tiny speaker grate. And yet, they
				had the strength to stir a deep instinctual response in me, lifting
				hairs on my neck and arms.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dissecting these small recordings, I spent weekends and car rides
				painstakingly recreating sounds and arrangements in GarageBand's mobile
				app. I manually tapped in MIDI runs, aimlessly played with parameters
				for effects I hardly knew the purpose off (lord knows what a compressor
				does, I thought it just made guitars sound more plucky though that's not
				too far off), and recorded audio through the tiny hole of a speaker
				within my headphone's volume module.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those small recordings soon grew too large for a tiny touchscreen. I
				needed more from audio. There was so much more ground I could cover, and
				so little room left on my phone's storage. Come senior year of high
				school, I wandered into the territory of professional-grade production
				software. Skipping the desktop version of GarageBand entirely, I soon
				found myself staring into the gaping hole that is a fully fledged DAW,
				Logic Pro X to be specific. I was soon inundated with dynamic and
				time-based effects, modulators, parametric EQ, routing, and an extensive
				library of sounds and instruments.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a time, it was new, wonderful, intriguing. I had no idea what was
				actually going on with the turn of each knob, how to best use each tool
				to make my recordings better, or what “better” even meant. For a time,
				it meant “soaked in reverb” and “muddy to hell,” but these were rites of
				passage. Porting over my sessions from GarageBand, I fleshed out their
				barebones ideas, re-recorded other aspects, fantasized about showing
				these songs to everyone I knew like I had something to prove. With every
				tool you ever could need at your disposal, you can achieve anything,
				right?
			</p>
			<p>
				When I used to toil over tiny controls, furiously thumbing my phone
				screen in landscape to write out a MIDI melody, ideas were immediate.
				Whatever I heard could precipitate in an instant, a single touch. There
				was never a time I stared at that tiny screen and felt lost. And yet,
				here I was, sitting in front of Logic's premier sampler synth, Alchemy,
				stumbling and tripping down a preset browser without a single aim. There
				was no transformation or transmutation from one element to another, just
				a cacophony of one-second previews as I looked for a sound that would
				trigger some inspiration.
			</p>
			<p>
				At times I labored in Logic for hours, coming out with nothing to show
				for it but two chords and a slightly sweatier chair. Making a recording
				felt tedious. Plug in the guitar. Check the levels. Noodle. Record a
				little chord progression. It's clipping? Check the levels again. Fixed?
				Well, now you've listened to that chord progression too much and hate
				it. Why not just jam that one riff you know from that one song? Sounds
				better than anything you could ever come up with.
			</p>
			<p>Maybe I'll call it a day.</p>
			<p>
				I think I accidentally called it a few years. Across my time as an
				underclassman, very little happened. Not a single finished song. Not a
				single idea that came to fruition. Hours and hours spent in Logic,
				Ableton, even FL Studio on rare occasion, but very little progress.
				Every now and then there'd be a recording done for a class which I'd
				feel satisfied with. Enough to tide me over for a few months listening
				to it, really savoring that tiny pang of pride and accomplishment. I
				often fantasized about my ideas being so good that if I were to release
				them, they'd be met with heavy praise. Emphasis on the “if I were to
				release” part.
			</p>
			<p>
				No matter what, the re-realization would set back in that something
				wasn't working. That sense of wonder and curiosity, motivation and
				gratification, that unadulterated drive to create, gone. I watched as
				musicians around me put love into their craft, made both bad music and
				good music. They seemed okay with the bad music. I wouldn't stand it for
				a single second if it came from my hands, so I made nothing. I listened
				and fantasized that I had some x-factor which set me apart from them.
				It's okay I never finished or put anything out, as long as I could
				convince myself I was better than them.
			</p>
			<p>
				But musicians these days are talented. Ludicrously talented. If you've
				somehow convinced yourself for a second that you can keep up with these
				artists who really give it their all, you're definitely wrong. They love
				this craft. They have the guts to bare their work to themselves and
				others. Even faced with a growing musical language, breadth of tools,
				and already incomprehensibly large pool of like-minded and talented
				peers, they keep creating. They don't compare, they contrast. And here I
				am comparing.
			</p>
			<p>
				As I kept comparing myself to every small musical threat around me, the
				walls came up. I became everything I hated about musicians. Judging,
				gatekeeping, bitter, overwhelmed, dumping thousands of dollars on
				equipment and software I'd never use, subsisting solely on pride and
				praise. I couldn't even listen to music anymore. I would mix a single
				song for an entire year and just not release it. In the rare case I did
				release something, it only stirred unease. That and a furious obsession
				with release metrics. Sheesh.
			</p>
			<p>
				With that, my creation came to a standstill in my final year of
				undergrad. I never moved an inch beyond class assignments. I knew how to
				use all these tools but just didn't care. It wasn't fun.
			</p>
			<p>
				I made the conscious decision to quit music the summer after graduation.
				It was either one endeavor or another, and I chose to go all into a
				computer science career. Studying technicals and doing side projects was
				going to take up most of my time. While leading up to that decision it
				felt like a cop out, it was probably one of the most freeing decisions
				I've ever made in my life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes we stretch ourselves thin. Convince ourselves that we're
				better than others. Take every tiny bit of enjoyment for granted in
				favor of shinier things. I miss those times tapping at GarageBand,
				muddying the hell out of my recordings, not giving a damn about dynamic
				range, high passes, or the timbre of a snare. Sound was a promise of an
				emotion, something tiny and imperceptible yet punching far above its
				weight class. It meant something to me, and I didn't need to think about
				it for that to be the case.
			</p>
			<p>
				For me, music is not the right venture at the current moment. I need to
				reevaluate and re-cultivate my love for it while not under the constant
				pressure to create. I can't bring myself to continue until I can
				re-muster that appreciation I once had. In coming to that conclusion,
				for the first time in my musician's tumult, I feel peace. I'll watch
				others grow and succeed, fail and grow, share a love for the strange
				movements of these strange little particles. Because my music is tiny
				and imperceptible. My music flourishes on a single-octave touchscreen
				keyboard. My music takes up the corners of loose-leaf paper. My music is
				there for me when I next need it.
